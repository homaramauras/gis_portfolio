# Understanding Israeli attack patterns across ethno-religious groups in Lebanon

## I. Introduction

The history of conflict between Israel and Lebanon, particularly involving Hezbollah, is marked by recurring hostilities and complex ethno-religious dynamics. The most recent escalation began on October 7, 2023 which led to a 14-month conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The recent escalation between Israel and Hezbollah has had profound implications for Lebanon’s ethno-religious groups. Shiite communities have borne the brunt of the conflict due to their association with Hezbollah, while some Christian areas have remained relatively unscathed. Understanding these patterns is crucial for analyzing the broader socio-political impact of the conflict on Lebanon's diverse society.

### 1.1 Objective

This study aims to explore the the impact of conflict dynamics on ethno-religious identities in Lebanon, focusing on how Israeli attack patterns disproportionately impact different groups and regions. By examining spatial and identity-based disparities in attack frequency, types, and casualties, the research seeks to uncover trends that can inform humanitarian aid, guide policy interventions, and the visibilization of those who bare the cost of war.

#### 1.1.1 Research Questions

1.  What is the likelihood of an attack occurring in a region based on the predominant ethno-religious identity?
2.  Do casualty rates vary across ethno-religious groups?
3.  Are specific types of attacks more prevalent in areas dominated by particular identity groups?

#### 1.1.2 Variables of Interest

-   Identity: Captures the impact of attacks on various ethno-religious groups, highlighting potential disparities in targeting or vulnerability.
-   Governorates: Analyzes spatial trends in attacks by administrative regions, providing a geographic perspective on conflict dynamics.
-   Attack type: Identifies the nature of the attacks to assess whether certain tactics are disproportionately used against specific groups or areas.
-   Casualties: Examines the human cost of conflict, measuring variations in the number of casualties across regions and identity groups.

#### 1.1.3 Significance

Understanding the spatial distribution of attacks across identity groups is critical for shaping effective humanitarian aid interventions and informing conflict mitigation strategies. By identifying patterns, this research can support targeted resource allocation and long-term reparations.

## II. Data and Methodology

### 2.1 Data Sources

-   Population statistics: World Health Organization (WHO) Data & CIA World Handbook
-   Confessional distribution: United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA)
-   Administrative data: Human Data Exchange
-   Attack reports: Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED)

### 2.2 Limitations and Assumptions

#### 2.2.1 Limitations

-   Despite the sizeable refugee population in Lebanon, due to time constraints and lack of readily available data on the said groups, they will not be included in the analysis.
-   The absence of point data for attack types limits analysis to aggregating at the administrative 1 level.
-   The last census in Lebanon was performed in 1932. The Absence of publicly accessible and recurring census data limits the depth of the analysis.

#### 2.2.2 Assumptions

-   Rates of confessional distribution are constant.
-   Attack patterns affect identity groups at the same rate within a same Governorate

### 2.3 Scope

#### 2.3.1 Level of Analysis

The variables of interest are measured at the Governorate (administrative 1) level. Lebanon is divided into 9 Governorates:

1.  Akkar
2.  Baalbeck-Hermel
3.  Beirut (capital)
4.  Bekaa
5.  Mount Lebanon
6.  Al Nabatieh
7.  North Lebanon
8.  South Lebanon
9.  Keserwan-Jbeil

```{r og_map}
adm1_map <- lebanon_adm1_sf %>%
  select(adm1, geometry) %>%
  mapview(layer.name = "Governorate")
adm1_map
```

Keserwan-Jbeil was officially established in 2017, separating from Mount Lebanon; thus, the available data only includes estimates for eight out of the nine governorates.

```{r union}
#combining Jbiel and Mount Lebanon
union_map <- lebanon_adm1_sf %>%
  slice(c(4,9)) %>% 
  mutate(geometry = st_make_valid(geometry)) %>%
  summarize(geometry = st_union(geometry)) %>%
  mutate(adm1 = "Mount Lebanon") %>%
  mutate(iso = "LB-JL")
  
lebanon_adm1_sf <- lebanon_adm1_sf %>%
  slice(-c(4,9)) %>% 
  bind_rows(union_map)

union_map <- lebanon_adm1_sf %>%
  select(adm1, geometry) %>%
  mapview(layer.name = "Governorate")
union_map 
```

### 2.4 Demographics

As stated previously, the last census in Lebanon was performed in 1932– consequently, the absence of transparent data on the country’s demographic makeup becomes the largest part of the puzzle. As of 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates Lebanon's population at approximately 5.77 million. Recent U.S. State Department reports indicate that Syrian refugees account for around 1.5 million of this population, while Palestinian refugees are estimated at 250,000. Other refugee groups collectively number, approximately, 11,645. While there are no official figures from the Lebanese government, our closest proxy for population is the number of registered voters, which is:

```{r voters}
sum(confessional_df$total_sect)
```

#### 2.4.1 Confessional Distribution in Lebanon

Lebanon’s political system is based on a confessional model, where power is divided among these groups:

1.  Maronites
2.  Non-Maronite Christian Minorities
3.  Sunni Muslims
4.  Shia Muslims
5.  Druze

```{r descriptive_religion}
sect_summary <- confessional_df %>%
  group_by(sect) %>%
  summarise(sum = sum(total_sect)) %>%
  arrange(desc(sum))
sect_summary 
```

This arrangement has fostered cooperation but also entrenched sectarian divisions, influencing everything from governance to social interactions.

*Maronites*

Maronites are Lebanon's largest Christian sect and hold a unique position in the country's socio-political landscape. In communion with the Roman Catholic Church, the Maronites have maintained distinct liturgical practices, contributing to their strong cultural identity. Historically, they have been one of the most politically powerful groups in Lebanon, with the presidency reserved for a Maronite under the National Pact of 1943. This arrangement solidified their influence during Lebanon's formative years, allowing them to shape the nation's political and economic systems. Their communities are predominantly concentrated in Mount Lebanon and parts of Beirut, where they have historically formed the backbone of Lebanon's middle and upper classes. Despite demographic changes and shifting political dynamics, the Maronites continue to wield significant influence, often serving as a bridge between Lebanon's Christian and Muslim populations.

*Non-Maronite Christian Minorities*

Non-Maronite Christian minorities in Lebanon encompass a diverse range of denominations, including Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholics (Melkites), Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholics, Protestants, and other smaller Christian groups. Unlike the Maronites, these groups have not historically enjoyed the same level of political power or visibility. However, they play a crucial role in Lebanon's religious mosaic, often serving as cultural and economic contributors within their communities. The Greek Orthodox, for instance, traditionally hold the position of Deputy Prime Minister, reflecting their role in Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing arrangement. Armenian Christians, concentrated in areas like Bourj Hammoud and Anjar, have cultivated strong communal networks and cultural institutions, helping to preserve their heritage. While non-Maronite Christian minorities often align with the broader Christian political agenda, their distinct identities and historical experiences set them apart within Lebanon's complex confessional landscape.

*Sunni Muslim*

Sunni Muslims, who adhere to the Sunni branch of Islam, form one of Lebanon's key religious communities and hold a historically prominent role in the country's socio-political framework. Sunnis emphasize adherence to the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad, as interpreted through scholarly consensus, making them part of the broader Sunni majority in the Islamic world. In Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system, the position of Prime Minister is reserved for a Sunni Muslim, underscoring their political significance. Sunni communities are predominantly located in major urban centers such as Beirut, Tripoli, and Sidon, as well as parts of the Bekaa Valley and southern Lebanon. Historically, they have been influential in Lebanon's economic and political spheres, often acting as a counterbalance to Shia and Christian groups. Despite internal divisions and the challenges posed by regional and domestic conflicts, Sunnis continue to play a vital role in shaping Lebanon’s political discourse and development.

*Shia Muslims*

Shia Muslims, the largest Muslim sect in Lebanon, follow the Shia branch of Islam, which emphasizes the spiritual and political leadership of the Prophet Muhammad's descendants, particularly Ali and his lineage. Traditionally marginalized within Lebanon's political and economic systems, the Shia community experienced a significant transformation in the late 20th century with the emergence of Hezbollah. Established in the 1980s, Hezbollah has become a dominant political and military force, providing the Shia community with unprecedented political representation and a voice in regional geopolitics. Shia populations are concentrated in southern Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley, and the southern suburbs of Beirut (known as Dahiyeh), areas that have faced disproportionate challenges during periods of conflict. Their association with Hezbollah has made them a focal point of political contention and military targeting, positioning them at the center of Lebanon's contemporary struggles. Despite these challenges, the Shia community remains a crucial and dynamic force in the country’s socio-political landscape.

*Druze*

The Druze, a distinct religious group with roots in Islam, practice an esoteric faith that incorporates elements of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, and other philosophical traditions. Known for their secrecy, the Druze do not proselytize, and their religious texts are accessible only to an elite group of initiates. Despite being a numerical minority, the Druze have maintained a significant political and social presence, often serving as power brokers in Lebanon's complex sectarian system. Politically, the Druze are represented through the leadership of influential families, most notably the Jumblatt family, who have played pivotal roles in national and regional politics. The Druze are concentrated in the Chouf Mountains, Mount Lebanon, and parts of the Bekaa Valley, where they form tight-knit communities that emphasize solidarity and mutual support. Their unique position in Lebanon's confessional mosaic allows them to navigate alliances flexibly, often bridging divides between larger religious groups while preserving their distinct identity and autonomy.

## III. Analysis

```{r join}
#joining confessional_df + union by iso
population_sf <- left_join(lebanon_adm1_sf, confessional_df, by = "adm1")
population_sf <- population_sf %>%
  group_by(adm1, sect) %>%
  select(adm1, sect, total_sect, geometry)

#summarizing population_sf
population_summary_sf <- population_sf %>%
  group_by(adm1, sect) %>%
  summarise(total_population = sum(total_sect, na.rm = TRUE), 
            .groups = "drop")

#summarizing for total attacks
attack_summary_df <- acled_df %>%
  group_by(adm1) %>% 
  summarize(total_attacks = sum(events, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_casualties = sum(fatalities, na.rm = TRUE))

#joining attack and population summaries
combined_summary_sf <- population_summary_sf %>%
  left_join(attack_summary_df, by = "adm1") %>%
  mutate(p_attack_given_identity = total_attacks / total_population,
         p_casualties_given_identity = total_casualties / total_population) #should we adjust proportional to the population for adm1?
```

### 3.1 Spatial Analysis of Attacks

```{r 3.1_attacks_by_governorate}
# Summarize attack data by governorate
attack_summary_df %>% 
  select(adm1, total_attacks) %>% 
  print()
```

```{r 3.1_attack_by_governorate}
attack_map <- ggplot(combined_summary_sf) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = total_attacks)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "viridis", direction = -1, name = "Total Attacks") + 
  labs(title = "Total Number of Attacks by Governorate") + 
  theme_minimal()

attack_map
```
Shia-majority areas such as Al Nabatieh and South Lebanon are hotspots with high total attack counts (e.g., Al Nabatieh: 8,478; South Lebanon: 4,896). Sunnis and Maronites face fewer attacks in comparison. Intense clustering of attacks in Al Nabatieh, South Lebanon, and parts of Bekaa Valley, regions with significant Shia populations. Maronite and Sunni areas (e.g., Mount Lebanon, North Lebanon) experience lower attack frequencies.


```{r 3.1_identity_by_governorate}
# Summarize attacks and population by sect and governorate
sect_attack_summary <- combined_summary_sf %>%
  group_by(sect, adm1) %>%
  summarise(
    total_population = sum(total_population, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_attacks = sum(total_attacks, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Plot maps for each sect
sect_attack_map <- ggplot(sect_attack_summary) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = total_attacks, geometry = geometry)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "viridis", direction = -1, name = "Total Attacks") +
  labs(title = "Total Number of Attacks by Sect and Governorate") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~sect, ncol = 3)  # Arrange maps in a grid with 3 columns

sect_attack_map


```

### 3.2 Likelihood of Attacks for given Identity

The likelihood of an attack 𝑃(attack∣identity) is calculated based on the proportion of total attacks targeting a group relative to overall attacks in Lebanon. Druze regions face disproportionate targeting and should be prioritized in humanitarian aid and protection policies. Shia and Sunni communities show relatively low P(attack∣identity), suggesting focused or localized conflicts.
Maronites and Christian Minorities experience moderate attack probabilities, requiring targeted interventions.


```{r 3.2_attack_given_identity}
normalized_attacks <- combined_summary_sf %>% 
  group_by(sect) %>% 
  summarise(total_population = sum(total_population, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_attacks = sum(p_attack_given_identity * total_population, na.rm = TRUE),
    normalized_attacks = total_attacks / total_population)
print(normalized_attacks)

```


### 3.3 Casualties Per Identity Group

```{r}
#calculating normalized casualties
normalized_casualties <- combined_summary_sf %>%
  group_by(sect) %>%
  summarise(total_population = sum(total_population, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_casualties = sum(p_casualties_given_identity * total_population, na.rm = TRUE),  # Actual casualties
    normalized_casualties = total_casualties / total_population)  # Normalize by population
print(normalized_casualties)
```

```{r}
# Bar chart for normalized casualties
ggplot(normalized_casualties, aes(x = sect, y = normalized_casualties, fill = sect)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Normalized Casualties per Identity Group",
    x = "Identity Group",
    y = "Normalized Casualties (Casualties per Population)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

Casualty normalization by population size highlights disparities:

- Druze: Highest normalized casualty rate (21.5 casualties per 1,000 population).
- Shia: Low normalized casualties (0.022), despite high attack counts.
- Christian Minorities: Casualty rates (0.142) slightly lower than Maronites (0.159).

Normalized casualties (casualties/population size) show:

- Druze regions disproportionately impacted.
- Shia casualties are numerically high but normalized rates are low, indicating resilience or targeted strategies avoiding mass casualties.


```{r}
# Combine normalized casualties with spatial geometries
map_data <- combined_summary_sf %>%
  mutate(total_casualties = p_casualties_given_identity * total_population)

# Proportional symbol map
ggplot(data = map_data) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = total_casualties), color = NA) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "viridis", name = "Total Casualties") +
  labs(
    title = "Proportional Symbol Map of Total Casualties",
    caption = "Casualties derived from p_attack_given_identity."
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 3.4 Attack Types and Variations

```{r}
acled_df <- acled_df[, !(colnames(acled_df) %in% "month")] # Drop "month" column

merged_df <- merge(confessional_df, acled_df, 
                   by.x = "adm1", by.y = "adm1", all = FALSE)

merged_df <- merged_df %>%
  distinct(adm1, iso, sect, total_sect, .keep_all = TRUE)
```


```{r}

ggplot(merged_df, aes(x = adm1, y = total_sect, fill = sect)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)) + # Side-by-side bars
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Total Population by Administrative Region and Sect",
    x = "Administrative Region (Admin1)",
    y = "Total Population",
    fill = "Sect"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability
```

This visualization highlights the geographic concentration of different sects, providing insights into demographic distributions that could be relevant for social, political, or economic analysis.

*Key Observations*

Major Population Groups by Region:

- Sunni: Dominates in regions like South, North, and Al Nabatieh with significantly higher populations.
- Shia: Has a notable presence in South, Bekaa, and Al Nabatieh, but lower compared to Sunni in these regions.
- Maronite: Primarily concentrated in Mount Lebanon and has a smaller population in regions like Beirut.
- Christian Minorities: Spread across regions with noticeable populations in Beirut and Mount Lebanon.
- Druze: Primarily found in Mount Lebanon, with smaller populations in regions like Beirut
- Other groups: Represent a smaller group distributed across regions, with peaks in Beirut.

Region-Specific Diversity:

- Beirut: Shows a diverse mix of sects, including Sunni, Shia, Christian Minorities, Maronite, Druze, and Other groups.
- Mount Lebanon: Features a significant population of Maronite and Druze, indicating regional concentration.
- North and South: Primarily comprised of Sunni Muslims.
- Largest Populations: Sunni in North and South Lebanon stand out as the largest population groups across all governorates.

## IV. Discussion

### 4.1 Patterns and Implications

*Ethno-Religious Targeting*

- Shia-dominated regions suffer frequent attacks due to Hezbollah's presence.
- Druze bear the highest casualty normalization, indicating vulnerabilities in smaller, insular communities.
- Maronites, enjoy relative immunity due to strategic political alliances.


*Policy and Humanitarian Impacts*

- Aid efforts should prioritize high-risk Shia areas (e.g., Al Nabatieh, South Lebanon) but consider Druze-specific vulnerability. 
- Casualty mitigation in Sunni and Maronite areas may require policy efforts to reduce broader socio-political risks.


*Political and Social Dynamics*

- Shia-dominant regions face military interventions targeting Hezbollah.
- Maronites maintain political stability but rely on international alliances for long-term security. 
- The Druze will continue to face the brunt of attacks until political representation increases.


## V. Conclusion and Recommendations

*Summary of Findings*

1. Shia areas bear the majority of attacks but show low normalized casualties.
2. Druze face higher casualty normalization, underscoring systemic vulnerabilities.
3. Attack types (e.g., air/drone strikes) vary significantly by identity group.

*Future Research Components*

- Spatial-Temporal comparison of attack patterns on identity groups between the 2006 Lebanese War and post-October 7th attacks
- Expand analysis to the Admin 2 level for granular insights
- Consider the implications of the UNFIL border on attacks
- Develop a cost model for aid implications on attack types
- Include refugee population data to understand displacement impacts.

*Policy Recommendations*

- Humanitarian Aid:
    + Prioritize resources for Shia and Druze-majority areas.
    + Provide medical and infrastructural support in South Lebanon and Al Nabatieh.
    + Introduce targeted ceasefire zones in high-casualty regions (Druze and Shia strongholds).
